    markdown:
      Being mainly a designer I interest myself in many subjects outside of what is immediately linked to my craft. The subjects on which I write interest me and I triedy to understand them more deeply by approaching them in writing. Before anyone else I write for myself. It can look as a documentation of things I know, or an abstract cracking of things that I donâ€™t know. It is a quest for meaning where the process is more important than the end result.
